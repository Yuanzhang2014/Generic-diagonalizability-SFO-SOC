# Generic-diagonalizability-SFO-SOC
Codes for algorithms in the paper Generic Diagonalizability, Structural Functional Observability and Output Controllability by Yuan Zhang, Tyrone Fernando, and Mohamed Darouach. 
We solve the minimum/maximum weight maximum matching problem using linear programming. Your Matlab version should support optimproblem and optimvar.
