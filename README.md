# Generic-diagonalizability-SFO-SOC
Codes for algorithms in the paper Generic Diagonalizability, Structural Functional Observability and Output Controllability by Yuan Zhang, Tyrone Fernando, and Mohamed Darouach. 

We solve the minimum/maximum weight maximum matching problem using linear programming. Your Matlab version should support optimproblem and optimvar.

A list of functions: 

Algorithm 1 : A weighted maximum matching based algorithm for P1 in generically diagonalizable systems.

Algorithm 2: A naive iterative algorithm to determine a feasible solution to P1 for general systems.

Algorithm 3 : A weighted maximum matching based algorithm for a feasible solution to P1 for general systems.

Algorithm 4:  A weighted maximum flow based algorithm to find an optimal solution to P2 in generically
diagonalizable systems.

ER_main: Generate Erd¨os-R´enyi (ER) random networks and empirically count the ratio of structurally diagonalizable ones.

minCostMaxFlow.m: Finding the minimum cost max flow.

stronglyConnectedComponents.m: Finding the strongly connected Components. 

Check_Generic_Diagonalizability: Check whether the matrix is generically diagonalizable. If yes,IfDiagonalizable=1; otherwise, IfDiagonalizable=0.
